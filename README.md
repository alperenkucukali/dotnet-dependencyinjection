# Dependency Injection and Service Lifetimes

This project is a sample of "How to use of Dependency Injection and Service Lifetime" in .NET 8.

# What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows software components to rely on externally provided dependencies. This pattern enables a component to receive its dependencies from the outside rather than managing them internally. This means that components are not directly tied to each other, but instead, dependencies are managed outside the component.

# What are the Dependency Injection Methods?

* **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed to the component's constructor as parameters.
* **Property Injection:** Dependencies are assigned to the properties of the component.
* **Method Injection:** Dependencies are passed to the methods of the component as parameters.

# Why Should We Use Dependency Injection?

* **Flexibility:** DI reduces tight coupling between components, making the code more flexible and modifiable.
* **Testability:** DI facilitates easy modification of dependencies and substitution with mock objects, making the code more testable.
* **Ease of Maintenance:** DI makes the code more modular, which in turn simplifies maintenance and debugging.
* **Reusability:** By reducing tight relationships between dependencies, DI increases the reusability of components.

# What are the Service Lifetime Types?

When using Dependency Injection, the lifecycle of injected dependencies should also be considered. The lifecycle determines how long a component will live and can generally be of three main types: **Singleton, Transient, and Scoped.**

* **Singleton:** A component is created only once throughout the application and the same instance is used for all requests. This is useful when the same instance is shared across the application, such as a database connection or a settings manager.
* **Transient:** A new instance of the component is created for each request. This increases memory consumption but is ideal when state sharing between dependencies is not desired.
* **Scoped:** A component is created within a specific scope and uses the same instance throughout that scope. This is typically valid between the start and end of a specific scope, like an HTTP request. Scoped is particularly useful for handling multiple client requests in applications like web applications.

# Conclusion

Dependency Injection reduces tight coupling between components, making the code more testable, flexible, and easier to maintain. Additionally, Dependency Injection provides flexibility in how components are created and used through lifecycle types. Therefore, learning and implementing Dependency Injection can improve the quality and flexibility of your software projects.
